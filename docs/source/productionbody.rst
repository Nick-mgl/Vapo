1.1 Description
-----------------

The body of the device has two parts. The bigger part has all the electronic components and heating chamber. The smaller part is the cover and it has a smoking pipe inside it. 

1.2 Materials
-----------------

Filament for the printer.

As I recommend to use raisin 3D printer, the filament should be high-temperature resistant. However, you can try to experiment with different filaments and types of printers. Please, keep attention to the specification of the filament and do not use it if it is toxic or not heat-resistant.

The filaments that ideal for our purposes is Formlabs High Temp Resin (https://formlabs-media.formlabs.com/datasheets/High_Temp_Technical.pdf)
