Purpose
============

Hello, my dear friend. I am happy to know that you found this page. I hope that you will find some interesting information here that will help you to get you on a new level.

If you are here, I can make several assumptions. First, you are probably interested in the subject of cannabis, second, you are a creative person, and you are looking for an opportunity to fulfill your intention to create. I am just like you.

So let me explain why being creator is great. I will explain it on the example of my device. But, It does not necessarily mean that being a creator is to create an electronic device. Being a creator means doing something new to you. Not something new to humanity. If you start doing something new, you change your reality. And this is the purpose of every creator.

You can come up with a new approach to teach people or to manage people. Or you can write a poem. Or draw a picture. Or start video blogging. But I did my first electronic device.

Try to analyze those people who inspire you. Those people are creators in all cases. They do something new. So, what should we do with our inspiration? We should become creators and realize our ideas. Why because we do not want to struggle when we need to forget about our ideas. And! Because being just a consumer is boring. 
Nobody cares what car Bill Gates drives. Nobody cares what pants Elon Musk wears. What we care about is what these people create. Creativity is a new King in the modern world!

If we consume, we do not fill our true nature. Because humans always tried something new. This habit made us get here after many things that happen after the monkey took a stick and started to dig.
