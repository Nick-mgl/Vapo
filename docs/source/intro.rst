Introduction
============

Hello, my dear friend. I am happy to know that you found this page. I hope that you will find some interesting information here that will help you to get you on a new level.

If you are here, I can make several assumptions. First, you are probably interested in the subject of cannabis, second, you are a creative person, and you are looking for an opportunity to fulfill your intention to make your idea real. I am just like you, I am inspired by creators and I want to be one too.

Being just a consumer is boring. If we only consume, we do not fill our true nature. Nobody cares what car Bill Gates drives. Nobody cares what pants Elon Musk wears. What we care about is what these people create. Creativity is a new King in the modern world!  Humans always tried something new. This habit made us get where we are now. 

Being a creator is great. It does not necessarily mean that you must create an electronic device. Being a creator means doing something new to you. If you start doing something new, you change your reality. And this is the purpose of every creator. You can come up with a new approach to teach people or to manage people. Or you can write a poem, or draw a picture, or start video blogging. 

I made an electronic device, I enjoyed it, and I want to share it with you.

About me
-----------------

My name is Nick. I was born in 1984. I had been working in the financial industry for almost all my career, but I always was an engineer by nature. 

I was 34 when I have decided to make this project. I knew nothing about production and design.  After one year I finished my device. I have learned 3D printing, 3D scanning, laser cutting, 3d engineering design, molding and casting, CNC, electronic board soldering, programming and many more. Surprisingly the result overcame all my expectations. The vaporizer is easy to use, it is portable, and it is extremely efficient compared to the vaporizers that I have tested before.  

Second I am a strong believer in smart consumption, responsible consumption, consumption of herbs that will make us move further. This project is also dedicated to this idea. This open-source project is a humble attempt to inspire you to explore the new world, the world of creativity by making the device for smoking herbs. 

I can call myself “creator” now. And I want you to enjoy this powerful feeling.

The purpose of the project
-----------------

The purpose of the project is to give people another opportunity to learn something cool. Especially for those who empower their creativity with the help of cannabis. Those people are the most curious to live. Those who want to go further in their way of self-development. People, who smoke cannabis in major try to overcome their abilities and be open-minded to many things. Therefore, I believe that there is a group of people who will be interested to repeat what I did and get a beautiful piece of their creativity. They will make something functional and cool from a bunch of different materials.

I hope you are one of them. If so, I can promise to you that you will have fun, when you finally turn the device on and make the first shot. You will understand that you actually CAN create. You can make your dreams come true. 

Smart consumptions concept
-----------------

*“The key to living without regrets is accepting responsibility for your own decisions and staying committed to a full and productive life - not mindless obedience”*

Steve DeAngelo, “The manifesto of cannabis”

Herbs should help you to grow, to become better. If you decided to consume it, be responsible for your life, your behavior, and everything that happens to you. Respect other people, and try to figure out how to benefit from consuming herbs.

I want to support the idea of smart consumption with my project. You can not just buy and smoke. You can educate yourself, and create a useful device, that will help you to figure out, how different temperature affects the effect that user has.
