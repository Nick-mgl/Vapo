1.1 Description
-----------------

The heating chamber is the main part of the vaporizer. It is the part where the herbs get hot to evaporate the compounds.  

Also, this part is the most difficult to make. The material should be non-toxic, heat resistant, solid, non-conductive and easy to transfer the heat.

There are two ways of heating that common vaporizers have: conduction and convection. 

Here is the picture that demonstrates the difference:

There are pros and cons in both of these ways. Therefore, to eliminate the cons of each heating mode, it is better to combine them.

The heating chamber in this project has both ways of heating.  Therefore, there are two coils. One coil heats the inner walls of the chamber. Oner one heats the air that flows through the herbs.

There are three parts made of ceramic and one part (small grill) made of metal.
