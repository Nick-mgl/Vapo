What about tools?
============

You probably will be surprised, but there are many options for you to build your electronic device. Yes, you can do it at your garage (if you have one). But in this case, you will need to buy a lot of different equipment. I suggest you start with a collaboration with the local workshop in your town. 
Several organizations build the network of the workshops, where creative individuals and companies can prototype their products. I suggest you to google the following words together with the name of your city or country:

- FabLab
- Fabacademy
- Makerspace
- Hackspace

I am pretty sure you can find some options not far from you.
